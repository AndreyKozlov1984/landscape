# Cloud Native Landscape Project

The [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io) Cloud Native Landscape
Project is intended as a map through the previously uncharted terrain of cloud native technologies. This attempts to categorize many of the most popular projects and product offerings in the cloud native space. It is under development by [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io) with assistance from [Redpoint](https://www.redpoint.com/) and [Amplify](http://www.amplifypartners.com). There are many routes to deploying a cloud native application, with CNCF Projects representing a particularly well-traveled path.

Suggestions for improvements are welcome. Please keep in mind these considerations:

* We generally will only list a company in one box, to represent its major or best known offering. We occasionally make exceptions for large companies.
* Projects with at least 250 GitHub stars that clearly fit in an existing category are generally included.
* We are unlikely to create a new category for products/projects as we'd rather find the best home with the current options.
* We are generally not including commercial versions of open source software, when that version just includes minor tweaks.
* Closed source products need to link to a clear description of your product; no stealth mode companies.
* Your project or company needs a logo and the logo needs to include the name.

If you think your company or project should be included, please open an
[issue](https://github.com/cncf/landscape/issues/new).
