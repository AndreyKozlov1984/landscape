# Cloud Native Landscape Project

The [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io) Cloud Native Landscape
Project attempts to categorize many of the most popular projects and
startups in the cloud native space. It is under development by
[CNCF](https://www.cncf.io), [Redpoint](https://www.redpoint.com/)
and [Amplify](http://www.amplifypartners.com).

Suggestions for improvements are welcome. Please see below considerations and open an
[issue](https://github.com/cncf/landscape/issues/new).

* We generally will only list a company in one box, to represent it's major or best known offering. We occasionally make exceptions for large companies.
* Projects with at least 250 GitHub stars that clearly fit in an existing category are generally included.
* We're unlikely to create a new category for products/projects as we'd rather find the best home with the current options.
* We are generally not including commercial versions of open source software, when that version just includes minor tweaks.
