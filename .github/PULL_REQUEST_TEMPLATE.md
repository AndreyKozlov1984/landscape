* [ ] Are you including an SVG or (less preferably) a large PNG?
* [ ] Does your logo clearly state the name of the project/product and follow the other logo [guidelines](https://github.com/cncf/landscape#logos)?
* [ ] Does your project/product name match the text on the logo?
* [ ] Have you verified that the Crunchbase data for your organization is correct (especially headquarters)?
